***Project name :
AI-Powered Open-Sicence Semantic Search System (APOSSS)

***Project Overview :
An intelligent search system that accepts a user's natural language query (representing a problem or research subject) and suggests relevant resources from multiple, distinct local MongoDB databases:
Academic_Library (books, journals, projects)
Experts_System (experts, certificates)
Research_Papers (articles, conferences, theses)
Laboratories (equipments, materials)

***Goals and Objectives :
1. Integrate a Large Language Model (LLM) for advanced query understanding, including spelling correction, intent detection, named entity recognition, keyword extraction, synonym generation, and related specialization identification.
2. Implement a search mechanism to query the 4 local MongoDB databases based on the LLM's enriched output (Research Papers, Library, Laboratories, Experts).
3. Develop an AI model to rank the retrieved resources by relevance and usefulness to the user's research query and  user's research needs.
4. Implement a user feedback mechanism to allow the AI ranking model to learn and improve over time.

***In Scope:
1. User interface for query input.
2. Query processing via an LLM.
3. Searching across the specified local MongoDB databases based on the provided schemas.
4. AI-driven ranking of search results.
5. Display of ranked results.
6. User feedback mechanism for result relevance.
7. Basic mechanism for the AI ranking model to learn from feedback.

***Expected Outcomes :
##A functional prototype of the search system capable of:
1. Accepting a user's textual research query.
2. Processing the query using an LLM to extract meaningful search terms, intent, entities, and related concepts.
3. Retrieving potentially relevant data items from all connected MongoDB databases.
4. Presenting a ranked list of these resources to the user, with the AI model determining the initial ranking.
5. Allowing users to provide feedback (e.g., "helpful" / "not helpful") on the relevance of the search results.

##A demonstration of the AI ranking model's ability to adjust or improve its rankings based on accumulated user feedback (even if the improvement mechanism is simplified for the project's scope).

***Core Modules & Functionality :
1. User Interface (UI) & Query Input:
A web-based interface where users can type their research query.
A section to display the search results.
Elements for users to provide feedback on each result.

2. Query Processing Module (LLM-based):
Receives the raw query from the UI.
Sends the query to an LLM.
Prompts the LLM to perform:
Spelling correction.
Intent detection (e.g., is the user looking for theoretical information, an expert, specific equipment, or materials?).
Named Entity Recognition (identifying specific concepts, technologies, people, organizations, locations, etc.).
Keyword extraction (main terms and phrases).
Synonym and related term generation (e.g., "car" -> "vehicle", "automobile"; "reducing" -> "decreasing", "mitigating").
Identification of related academic specializations or fields of study.
The module will parse the LLM's structured response (e.g., JSON) containing these enriched query parameters.

3. Multi-Database Search Module:
Receives the structured, enriched query parameters from the LLM module.
Constructs and executes queries against the respective MongoDB collections in each database:
Academic_Library: books, journals, projects
Experts_System: experts, certificates (linking certificates to experts via expert_id)
Research_Papers: articles, conferences, theses
Laboratories: equipments, materials
Queries will target relevant fields like title, abstract, description, keywords, category, author, student_name, supervisor, expert_name (from experts.name), job_complete.role, equipment_name, material_name, etc.
Aggregates all retrieved results into a common format for the ranking module.

4. AI Ranking Module:
Receives the aggregated list of search results.
Applies an AI model to score and rank these results based on their predicted relevance to the user's original query and the insights derived from the LLM (intent, entities, specializations).
The initial model might use a combination of text similarity scores (e.g., TF-IDF/Cosine Similarity between query terms and item content), keyword matching, and heuristic rules (e.g., prioritizing matches in titles or abstracts, or boosting items matching the detected intent).

5. Results Display Module:
Presents the ranked list of resources to the user in a clear, organized, and easily scannable format.
For each item, displays key information (e.g., title, type of resource, author/expert, a snippet of the abstract/description, source database).

6. Feedback Module:
Allows users to provide explicit feedback on the relevance of each search result (e.g., a "useful" or "not useful" button, or a simple rating).
Stores this feedback, linking it to the query and the specific result. This data is crucial for improving the AI Ranking Module.


***Technology Stack :
##Backend :
    Programming Language: Python
    Web Framework : Flask or FastAPI
    Database: MongoDB (existing subsystems databases)
    Large Language Model (LLM): Gemini-2.0-flash or Gpt-4o mini
    Machine Learning: scikit-learn ( For TF-IDF, cosine similarity, basic classifiers if framing ranking as a classification task, and other ML utilities.)
    Vector Database: Chroma

##Frontemd :
    Framework: Vanilla JS
    Styling: Tailwind CSS


***Detailed Steps: 
    1. User Input: The user types their research query into the UI.
    2. Query to Backend: The UI sends this raw query to the backend application.
    3. LLM Processing: The backend forwards the query to the LLM Query Processing Module.
        The LLM analyzes the query and generates structured output (e.g., a JSON object containing keywords, identified entities, detected intent, synonyms, and related specializations).
    4. Enriched Query to Backend: The LLM module returns this structured data to the backend.
    5. Database Search Initiation: The backend uses the enriched query parameters to instruct the Multi-Database Search Module.
    6. Targeted Database Queries: The Search Module constructs specific queries for each MongoDB database and its relevant collections.
        Example for "reducing carbon emissions in cars":
            Academic_Library.books: Search title, abstract, keywords for "carbon emission*", "reduc*", ("car" OR "vehicle" OR "automotive").
            Experts_System.experts: Search job_complete.role, general_information.slogan (or a new specializations field if added) for "environmental engineering", "automotive engineering", "emission control".
            Research_Papers.articles: Search title, abstract, authors (keywords if available) for similar terms.
            Laboratories.equipments: Search equipment_name, description, specifications for "carbon sensor", "emission analyzer".
        MongoDB's $text search (requires text indexes on relevant fields) or regex queries ($regex) can be used. Consider combining multiple query clauses with $and / $or
    7. Results Retrieval: Each database returns matching documents
    8. Aggregation: The Search Module collects all results and standardizes them into a common format (e.g., each result has a title, snippet, type, source, original_id).
    9. Ranking Initiation: The backend sends this aggregated list of unranked results, along with the original query context (and LLM insights), to the AI Ranking Module.
    10. AI Ranking: The AI model scores each result for relevance and sorts the list.
    11. Results to UI: The backend sends the final ranked list to the UI.
    12. Display: The UI presents the results to the user.
    13. User Feedback: The user interacts with the results and provides feedback (e.g., marks a result as "highly relevant" or "not relevant").
    14. Feedback to Backend: The UI sends this feedback data to the backend.
    15. Feedback Storage: The backend stores the feedback, associating it with the query and the specific item.
    16. Model Improvement: Periodically (or in a batch process), this stored feedback is used to retrain or fine-tune the AI Ranking Module.


***Key Considerations & Database Schema Notes :
##LLM Prompt Engineering: The quality of your LLM's output heavily depends on how well you design your prompts. Iterate on these. For "reducing carbon emissions in cars," the LLM should ideally identify:
Keywords: "carbon emissions," "cars," "reducing."
Synonyms/Related: "vehicle," "automobile," "decrease," "mitigation," "lower."
Entities: "carbon dioxide (CO2)," specific car technologies (if mentioned).
Intent: Find solutions/research/experts related to lowering vehicle emissions.
Related Specializations: "Environmental Engineering," "Automotive Engineering," "Chemical Engineering," "Atmospheric Science."

##MongoDB Text Search:
For effective searching in MongoDB, create text indexes on the fields you intend to search frequently (e.g., title, abstract, description, keywords in books, articles, projects; role, slogan in experts; equipment_name, description in equipments).
Use the $text operator with $search for indexed text searches.

##AI Ranking Model Complexity: Start simple. A sophisticated learning-to-rank (LTR) model is likely too complex for the initial scope. Demonstrating improvement with a simpler model based on feedback is a solid achievement.


##Leveraging Database Schemas for Search:
Academic_Library:
    books, journals, projects: title, author/student_name/supervisor, category, description, abstract, keywords are all prime candidates for searching. publication_date can be used for filtering/sorting.

Experts_System:
    experts: name, general_information.slogan, job_complete.role, general_information.locations, general_information.languages. Consider if a dedicated specializations array field could be added by your colleagues for better matching.
    certificates: Search title, institution, description. Link back to experts via expert_id.

Research_Papers:
    articles, conferences, theses: title, authors/student_name/supervisor, abstract/summary, keywords (if present). year/published/defense_date for temporal aspects.

Laboratories:
equipments: equipment_name, description, model, specifications. status for availability.
materials: material_name, description. status for availability.

Cold Start for AI Ranker: The initial ranking will rely on your heuristics or an unsupervised model (like cosine similarity). The system will only get "smarter" as it collects user feedback.
Handling Diverse Data Types: Your ranking model will need to consider how to compare relevance across very different item types (e.g., an expert vs. a piece of lab equipment vs. a research paper). The LLM's intent detection can help here (e.g., if intent is "find expert," rank experts higher).


**Development Phases
##Phase 1: Foundation & LLM Query Understanding :
    1. Set up the development environment (Python, MongoDB, Git).
    2. Establish connections to local MongoDB instances.
    3. Select and integrate with an LLM (Gemini API).
    4. Develop the core Query Processing Module:
        Design effective prompts for the LLM to extract keywords, intent, entities, synonyms, and specializations.
        Implement logic to send queries to the LLM and parse its structured JSON response.
    5. Basic UI for query input and displaying raw LLM output (for testing).

    Goal: Reliably transform a natural language user query into a rich set of structured search parameters using the LLM.

##Phase 2: Multi-Database Search Implementation :
    1. Develop the Multi-Database Search Module.
    2. Implement functions to query each specified collection in your MongoDB databases based on the provided schemas.
    3. Use the structured parameters from Phase 1 to build dynamic MongoDB queries (e.g., using PyMongo).
    4. Aggregate results from all sources into a unified list.
    5. Extend UI to display unranked, aggregated search results.

    Goal: Retrieve a comprehensive set of potentially relevant items from all databases based on the LLM-processed query.

##Phase 3: AI Ranking Model (Initial Version) & Basic Feedback :
    1. Develop an initial version of the AI Ranking Module. Start with:
        Heuristic-based ranking: Assign scores based on where keywords match (title vs. abstract), frequency, and alignment with LLM-detected intent/specializations.
        Or, TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity: Calculate similarity between the (LLM-expanded) query and the text content of each retrieved item.
    2. Implement a simple feedback mechanism in the UI (e.g., thumbs up/down per result).
    3. Store this feedback in a new MongoDB collection or simple file structure.
    4. Integrate ranking into the UI to display sorted results.

    Goal: Present results in a more relevant order than raw retrieval and start collecting data for future ranking improvements.

##Phase 4: Integration, Testing & Basic UI Refinement :
    1. Ensure all modules (UI, LLM Processing, Search, Ranking, Feedback) are fully integrated.
    2. Conduct thorough testing with a variety of realistic search queries.
    3. Refine LLM prompts based on test results.
    4. Improve the clarity and usability of the search results display.
    5. Begin basic analysis of collected feedback.

    Goal: A functional end-to-end prototype that demonstrates the core concept.

##Phase 5: Iteration & AI Model Improvement :
    1. Analyze collected user feedback.
    2. Attempt to improve the AI Ranking Model:
        If using heuristics, adjust weights based on feedback.
        If using a simple model (like logistic regression on features derived from query-item matches and feedback), retrain it with the collected feedback as labels.
    3. Document the system, including design choices, LLM prompting strategies, and ranking approach.
    4. Prepare for project demonstration.

    Goal: Show evidence of the system's ability to learn from feedback and refine its performance. Prepare a comprehensive project report.
