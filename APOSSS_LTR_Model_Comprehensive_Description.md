# APOSSS Learning-to-Rank (LTR) Model: Comprehensive Description

## Overview

The Learning-to-Rank (LTR) model in APOSSS is a sophisticated machine learning system that uses XGBoost to intelligently rank search results based on multiple feature dimensions. Unlike traditional ranking methods that rely on single scoring functions, the LTR model learns from user feedback and historical data to continuously improve search result relevance.

### Core Components

1. **LTRRanker Class**: Main orchestrator that manages model training, prediction, and feature extraction
2. **FeatureExtractor Class**: Advanced feature engineering component
3. **EnhancedTextFeatures Class**: Specialized text analysis features
4. **XGBoost Integration**: Gradient boosting framework for ranking optimization
